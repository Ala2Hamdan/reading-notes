* Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:
1.  before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2. inside the start of a paragraph
The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
3. in the middle of a paragraph
The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
