# Comparison and logical operators:
- Comparison operators :
you can evaluate a situation by comaring one value in the script to what you expect it might be . the result will be a booleen: true or false.
* == is equal to :
this operator compares two values (numbers, strings,or booleans)to see if they are the same.
* != is not equal to :
 this operator compares two values (numbers, strings,or booleans)to see if they are not the same.
 * === strict equal to :
 this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.
 * !== strict not equal to :
 this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same.
 * > greater than :
 this operator checks if the  number on the left is greater than the  number on light .
 * < less than :
 this operator checks if the  number on the left is less than the  number on light .
 * >= greater than or equal to :
 this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.
 * <= less than or equal to :
 this operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.
 - logical operators:
 * &&   logical AND :
 this operater test smore than one condition.and the result is true or false.
 * || logical OR : 
 this operater test smore than one condition.and the result is true or false.
 * ! logical NOT :
 this operater takes a single boolean value and inverts it .


# loops
loops check a condition . 
if  it returns true ,a code block will run.
then the condition will be checked again if it still returns true ,
the code block will run again .
it repeats until the condition returns false .
* there are three common types of loops:
1. FOR 
2. WHILE 
3. DO WHILE 

- FOR :
for (condition(counter)){
    code to excute during loop ;
}
- WHILE :
while (condition){
    code to excute during loop ;
}
#### notice:
. A more typical use of awhi le loop would be when you do not know how many times you want the code to run. It should continue to run as long as a condition is met.
