# Pair Programming :
 - *pair programming :* is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
 - How does pair programming work?
 two roles: 
 1. the Driver :is the programmer , write code ,deal with computer.
 2. the Navigator: is uses his words to guide the Driver, thinks about the big picture, look up solutions and documentation.
 - Why pair program?
 1.  Greater efficiency: long time but produces higher-quality code .
 2. Engaged collaboration : both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
 3. Learning from fellow students :working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.
 4. Social skills :When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. 
 5. Job interview readiness :Pair programming strengthens all of the important skills to job interview.
 6. Work environment readiness:Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
