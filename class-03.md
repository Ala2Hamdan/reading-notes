# HTML( LIST & BOXES)
There are three types of HTML lists:
1. Ordered lists: item use numbers.`<ol></ol>`
2. Unordered lists: item use bullet.`<ul></ul>`
*notice* : lists above butween openning and cloing tag have `<li><li>`
3. Definition lists:  are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms 
`<dl> 
    <dt></dt>
    <dd></dd>
</dl>`

*notice*: You can put a list inside an another list <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

# Boxes :
- each HTML element has a box around it .
- css deals with html element as boxes.
- this is CSS properties : 
* Box Dimensions : 
- `width`, `height`.
- `min-width`,` max-width`
- `min-height`,` max-height`
* Overflowing Content:
- `overflow` :tells the browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values: (`hidden`,`scroll`).
* Border, Margin & Padding
- `Border`(is the shorthand for border property `border: 3px dotted #0088dd;`)
`border-width`
`border-color`
`border-style`(soild,dotted,dashed,double,groove,....)
- `Margin`, `Padding` The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.

* Change inline/block :
- `display`
* Hiding boxes:
- `visibility`
* *CSS3 :Border Images*
- `border-image` 
* *CSS3: Box Shadows* 
- `box-shadow`allows you to add a drop shadow around a box
* *CSS3: Rounded Corners:
- `border-radius`create rounded corners on any box.
* *CSS3: Elliptical Shapes*
- `border-radius`To create more complex shapes, you can specify different distances for the horizontal and the vertical parts of the rounded corners.


# JAVASCRIPT
### *ARRAYS*
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
* *VALUES IN ARRAYS*
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list.
 It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
  ![image](image/img2.jpg)
 * *index* :is automatically number given to each item in the array,used to access specific items in the array.
  ![image](image/img3.jpg)
* *length* holds the number of items in the array.
* *ACCESSING & CHANGING VALUES IN AN ARRAY*
To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets.
You can change the value of an item an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (using the equals sign and the new value for that item).
   example: `colors[2] = 'beige ' ;`
  ### SWITCH STATEMENTS
  *A switch statement* starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
  ![image](image/img4.jpg)
 *  IF...ELSE VS. SWITCH
  ![IMAGE](image/img5.jpg)
* type coercion:that means JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation.
 ### LOOPS 
* loops check a condition . 
if  it returns true ,a code block will run.
then the condition will be checked again if it still returns true ,
the code block will run again .
it repeats until the condition returns false .
* there are three common types of loops:
1. FOR 
2. WHILE 
3. DO WHILE 

- FOR :
for (condition(counter)){
    code to excute during loop ;
}
- WHILE :
while (condition){
    code to excute during loop ;
}
- DO WHILE
do {
    code to excute during loop ;

}while(condition);
