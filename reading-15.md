# Why diversity matters to your tech company ?
1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
> Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.
2. Diverse companies perform better
3. Companies are losing out on great talent 
- Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent
4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 
5. Itâ€™s the right thing to do 
- the tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality.
