#### notice :
* Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
and your audience sometimes they are: individuals or Companies
* Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason
* You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively
* Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information (such
as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.
* Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.
# WireFrames :

information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.
# Getting your message across using design :
The primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.
# Visual hierarchy : 
Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
# grouping and Similarity :
When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend.
# Designing Navigation
Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.

#### Headers & Footers '<header> <footer>'
The header and footer elements can be used for:
* The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
* A header or footer for an individual <article> or<section> within the page.
#### Navigation <nav>
The '<nav>' element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
#### Articles <article>
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated
#### Article <aside>
The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.
When the '<aside>' element is used inside an <article>
element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
When the <aside> element is used outside of an<article>
element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page .
#### Sections <section>
The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
#### Heading Groups <hgroup>
The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 
#### Figures <figure> <figcaption>
the Figure it should only be used when the content simply references the element (and not for something that is absolutely integral to the flow of a page
Examples of usage include:(Images,Videos,Graphs,Diagrams,Code samples,Text that supports the main
body of an article)
The <figure> element should also contain a<figcaption> element which provides a text decription for the content of the <figure> element.
