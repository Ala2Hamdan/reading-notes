- is a programming paradigm to  construct and structure the code using functions.
 These functions take input which is called as arguments then shows the output 

- This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

- Functional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming that treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. 


## Pure functions
- Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments
- It does not cause any observable side effects

* if the function do or read an external file its not a pure function 
 * one of advantage of pure function it's easier to test
