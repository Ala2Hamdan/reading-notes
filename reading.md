 - is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers but Node programs aren't executed in a browser.
 - is often used for developing applications that rely on the ability to run javascript both on the client and server side.
 - allows for high efficiency as the program as a whole never has to idle and wait for one task to finish
 if one task stalls or pauses for an I/O operation, another can take over while it is idle
