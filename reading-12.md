# EJS Partials
- A way to reuse part of the HTML in multiple places.
* How can we do that?
- We define the parts that can be used more than once 
- We write them in separate ejs files - known as template -
- We include it in the html file by using the following tag with the filename for this part 
` <% - include (PARTIAL_FILE)%>`
